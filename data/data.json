Sophia Ordaz of Slant Magazine said 'While past Khruangbin albums risked coming off merely as studied tributes to the microcosms of Thai and Iranian rock, Mordechai finds Khruangbin coming into their own, thanks to the band's lyrical development and the honing of their fusion of intercontinental influences.' credit: wikipedia",

Today, both artists find themselves rising stars, garnering millions of streams and promoting the vision of a more diverse and open-minded Texas, the one that leads to headlines like this. credit: pitchfork",

        "albumname": "Texas Moon",
        "summary": "No matter the genre, a certain type of music will forever be specific to the American experience: road trip music. There's Willie Nelson's country-pop crossover 'On The Road Again,' quintessential 2010s indie-folk song 'Home' by Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros (music that Gen Z now refers to as 'stomp clap hey'), and the more euphemistic, exuberant 'Freeway of Love' by Aretha Franklin. Now with their second collaborative EP Texas Moon, neo-soul crooner Leon Bridges and psychedelic funk-rock trio Khruangbin deliver a different kind of road trip music.If Nelson's catalog is perfectly accompanied by a hot, dusty drive through the fast-food-lined interstate highways, Texas Moon is a project ideally listened to on a breezy, isolated, moon-lit drive home on country backroads. Each song is a lullaby of loungey and covertly seductive tones crafted to accompany late-night contemplative trips and, well, other after-hour activities. Texas Moon is the five-track sister project to Bridges and Khruangbin's unexpected-yet-successful 2020 EP Texas Sun, which earned Khruangbin their top-streamed songs (the title track has over 105 million streams on Spotify alone) and landed at No. 1 on Billboard Americana/Folk Albums chart. credit: paste magazine",
